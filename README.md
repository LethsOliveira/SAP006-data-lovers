# STUDIO GHIBLI CAT  


This Studio Ghibli Catalog was developed by me, Leths Oliveira and my study partner, [Let√≠cia Aniceto](https://github.com/leticia-aniceto) as part of the second project of the Bootcamp of [Laboratoria Brazil](https://www.laboratoria.la/br) Class 06!  

The project challenge was to create a web page containing info about Studio Ghibli (which thematic was choosen by us) working with a data base and filtering all the information into something easier to the user to sort it.  

So get ready to start a great adventure into de Ghibli World and to know better all the process behind the scenes of making a great Catalog for their fans.  

To get more information about the creation of this web page, click on the SRC folder and just scroll down!
