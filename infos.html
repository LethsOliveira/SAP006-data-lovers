           <h2 class="subtitle">How did this project come about?</h2>
           <h3 class="explanation">This website is a result of "Data Lovers Project", idealized and proposed by <a href="https://www.laboratoria.la/" target="_blank">Laboratoria's</a> Bootcamp. There were some themes available to treat data, like League of Legends, Pokémon, Rick and Morty and Studio Ghibli. We, the <a href="about.html" target="_blank">developers</a> of Studio Ghibli Catallogue, both love the animations produced by Studio Ghibli, so the choice was easy for us. Our intention is to bring a easy and fast way to consult and access the main information about movies and its characters developed by Studio Ghibli, like release date, director's name and name and age of our beloved characters, like Totoro. We really hope that you like the experience of use our project website. If you have any feedback, suggestions and ideas, please <a href="about.html" target="_blank">contact us</a>, we will be happy to hear and think together to enhance its performance.</h3>

            <h2>What is Studio Ghibli? </h2>
            <div id="totoro">
                <h3 class="explanation" id="intro">Studio Ghibli Inc. (Japanese: 株式会社スタジオジブリ, Hepburn: Kabushiki-gaisha Sutajio Jiburi) is a Japanese animation film studio headquartered in Koganei, Tokyo. The studio is best known for its animated feature films, and has also produced several short films, television commercials, and one television film. The studio's mascot and most recognizable symbol is the character Totoro (see image below), a giant cat-like spirit from the studio's 1988 film My Neighbor Totoro. Studio Ghibli's highest grossing films include Spirited Away (2001), Ponyo (2008), and Howl's Moving Castle (2004).</h3>
